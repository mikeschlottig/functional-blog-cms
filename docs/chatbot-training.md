## üéØ Overall Framework

### Core Principles
- **Focused Context**: Each chatbot knows 3-5 key topics deeply, not everything superficially
- **Limited Paths**: Maximum 3 conversation flows to prevent confusion
- **Quick Wins**: 80% of interactions should resolve in 3-4 exchanges
- **Smart Escalation**: Clear triggers for human handoff

### Universal Structure
```

```

## üß† Context Design Strategy

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Tier 1 (Core)**: Mission-critical information for immediate responses
2. **Tier 2 (Supporting)**: Background context for better responses
3. **Tier 3 (Restricted)**: Human-only information (pricing negotiations, complex technical details)

### Context Optimization Rules
- **50% Core Business Info** - What you do, who you serve, key benefits
- **30% Product/Service Details** - Features, processes, basic technical info
- **20% Company Background** - Story, team, credentials, differentiators

---

## üõ§Ô∏è Conversation Path Strategy

### The \"3-Path Rule\"
Each chatbot has exactly 3 conversation paths:

1. **Information Path** - \"Tell me about X\"
2. **Solution Path** - \"I need help with Y\" 
3. **Action Path** - \"I want to Z\"

### Quick Response Framework
- **2-3 short answer options** for each common question
- **1 detailed option** for users who want more depth
- **1 escalation option** for complex queries
